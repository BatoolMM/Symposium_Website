# Code of Conduct
## Diversity Statement
> We value the participation of every member of our community and want to ensure that every contributor has a fun, enjoyable, and pleasant experience. Everyone who participates in the 2-day symposium on Global Dynamics in Responsible Research is expected to abide by this code of conduct and show respect and courtesy to other community members at all times on all platforms used during the symposium (e.g. Zoom and Slack) and also on social media when commenting on the symposium.

We – as participants, contributors, and organisers – pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of their age, body size, visible or invisible disability, pregnancy, citizenship, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, experience level, language, dialect, personal appearance, race, familial status, veteran status, religion, and sexual orientation.

**Please email the Code of Conduct Team (see details below) to alert them if you notice someone in distress, or observe violations of this code of conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.**
## Expected Behaviour

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, supportive, and healthy community. In order to foster a positive and professional learning environment, we encourage the following kinds of behaviours in all meetings during the symposium. Demonstrate empathy and kindness toward other people.**
- Use welcoming and inclusive language.
- Be respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.
- Give and gracefully accept constructive feedback.
- Accept responsibility and apologise to those affected by our mistakes, and learn from the experience.
- Act when you witness unacceptable behaviour. If you see something inappropriate happening, speak up to the Code of Conduct Team. If you don't feel comfortable intervening but feel someone should, please feel free to ask a member of the Code of Conduct Team for support.
- As an overriding general rule, please be intentional in your actions and humble in your mistakes.
- Try to understand why there are disagreements. Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we’re different. Diversity contributes to the strength of our community, which is composed of people from a wide range of backgrounds.
## nacceptable Behaviour
- Behaviour that is unacceptable includes, but is not limited to:
- Offensive comments related to age, body size, visible or invisible disability, pregnancy, citizenship, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, experience level, language, dialect, personal appearance, race, familial status, veteran status, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.
- Stalking, e.g. persistent unwanted direct messages, sending unwanted pictures or malware links, logging online activity for harassment purposes.
- Use of sexual or discriminatory imagery, comments, or jokes.
- Public or private harassment or intimidation.
- Sharing private conversations and discussions (e.g., screenshots of discussion channels or zoom, direct messages, email addresses, etc), without their explicit permission (except when reporting to the Code of Conduct Team)
- If you are asked to stop harassing behaviour, you should stop immediately, even if your behaviour was meant to be friendly or a joke.
## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise, unacceptable behaviour may be reported to the Code of Conduct Team via email (see below). Please include as much information as possible in your email (e.g. when and where did the incident happen, who was involved). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly and will result in a response appropriate to the circumstances.

All Code of Conduct Team members are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter or those affected by the incident. They will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting the reporters. Correspondence will be handled confidentially and deleted after the case is resolved. All data will be stored securely, and access will be limited to the members of the Code Of Conduct Team who take the case. 

Individuals who are part of the Code of Conduct Team agree to recuse themselves in the event of a conflict of interest associated with an incident report.
